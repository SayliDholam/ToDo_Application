# ToDo_Application
A desktop application developed using Python Tkinter and MongoDb.

It will first ask the user to set login credentials, post which the user will have to select the 
category under which the user wishes to place the tasks. 
Entered tasks can be updated according to the user's requirements. After completing a task, the 
application will update the respective progress bar under each section. After accomplishing a 
task, a message will be conveyed to the user via speech, which will make the interface 
interactive.
